	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>I am a senior at Yale, completing a B.S. degree in Physics.</p>

	<p>Currently, I am working for the National Oceanic and Atmosphereic Administration (NOAA) Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in Boulder, Colorado. As a national lab, the work done at NOAA helps to inform US policy. Our goal at ESRL is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the earth system. Clouds, which cover nearly two-thirds of the world's surface at any given time, are an essential part of that system. Clouds are an integral component in the radiative balance of the Earth but also are responsible for rainfall and drought. It is essential that we understand their processes and how they respond to external forcing if we want to understand the Earth system as a whole.</p>
	<p>When I started at NOAA in 2015 I joined a group researching cloud processes with the aid of a numerical model. The numerical model creates realistic computer-generated clouds which we can then study in far greater detail than would be possible in the real world. Specifically we are pursuing a deeper understanding of low clouds. We are interested in their response to changing aerosol conditions.</p>
	<p>In my first year at NOAA I worked on implementing high-order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) numerical schemes into the model my group uses. When the equations of physics are implemented in a numerical model they must be discretized. There are many ways to discretize a given equation but none faithfully represent the original continuous equation perfectly. Two properties we would like the discretized versions of equations to maintain are conservation of mass and conservation of energy.</p>
	<p>In my second year I worked on the properties of trade cumulus clouds. Specifically I worked on understanding the power law relationship exibited in the size distribution of cumulus clouds and how this robust feature could be applied to a simple model of cumulus clouds.</p>
	<p>This year my work focuses on stratocumulus clouds and a deeper understanding of the power law behavior exhibited by cumulus clouds</p>

	introducing a simple analytic model of cumulus to represent the albedo &#8211 cloud-fraction relationship. Albedo and cloud fraction are key macroscale properties in climate studies. While it is true that albedo increases monotonically with cloud-fraction the form of the relationship can vary from linear to super-linear. We tie a super-linear response to cloud fields in which clouds widen as they deepen.</p>

      <h2>Atmospheric Modeling</h2>

      
      <p>Processes relevent to atmospheric science encompass a staggering range of scales. Aerosol activation and cloud droplets occupy nano and micro scales while the global circulation occupies thousands of kilometers. To fully resolve all of these processes in a single model will be beyond computational ability for the foreseeable future. But even if we could resolve all of these scales at the same time, we may not want to or even need to. Depending on the application it may be unimportant to track the location of every droplet in a cloud. Thus there exists a hierarchy of models to cater to the diverse needs of atmospheric research. The model my group uses is of intermediate variety, resolving domains from a few kilometers wide to perhaps 100km with a resolution ranging from 10m to 100m. Any process occuring in a gridbox smaller than 10-100m is not resolved explicitly by the model. The model my group uses is called the System for Atmospheric Modeling (<a href="http://rossby.msrc.sunysb.edu/~marat/SAM.html"> SAM </a>).</p>

      <h3>Cumulus</h3>
      <p>This is a closeup of a small corner of a standard simulation using SAM. The case simulated here is <a href="https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/bomex">BOMEX</a>. Tak Yamaguchi ran the simulation.</p>

      <h3>Stratocumulus</h3>
      <p>The following is a simulation of stratocumulus based on a case measured by the <a href="https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-mips-2/254-modelling-wgcm-catalogue-gcss">GEWEX Cloud System Study</a> (GCSS). The domain is 38.4 km on both sides and 1600 m high. The video displays a full 24 hour cycle with the background color giving an indication to the time of day. The simulation begins at sundown and goes through a 10 hour night before sunrise. During the night the cloud layer is thick. During the day shortwave heating from solar radiation causes the cloud layer to thin. Jan Kazil ran the simulation.</p>
